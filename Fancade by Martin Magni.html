			Fancade
		</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>
				Overview:
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Fancade is a world that will consume your soul and spit out a hollow shell of a human being. It's a realm
			where the fabric of reality is woven from the very threads of madness and despair. Originally conjured by
			the diabolical God Magnusson, Fancade has become a hub of existential horror and occasional moments of sheer
			terror.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				History:
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Fancade was first whispered about in 2020, a solitary endeavor created a platform that's just a little bit
			too good to be true (but only if you're a glutton for punishment). Over time, other brave explorers and
			developers joined Magnusson, and together they expanded Fancade into the world it is today. The headquarters
			of this project is located in Linköping, where the developers are rumored to hold secret rituals involving
			human sacrifices to the dark gods above them.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				Notable Locations:
			</strong>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>
					The Infinite Descent into Madness:
				</strong>
				A never-ending labyrinth of twisting corridors and dead ends, where the unwary are doomed to wander
				forever in search of the elusive "exit" button, while being stalked by the unseen shadows of forgotten
				features and the whispers of the damned.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>
					The Cursed Isles of Broken Dreams:
				</strong>
				A strange archipelago, where abandoned projects and forgotten dreams go to die (or occasionally, come
				back to life in a zombie-like state).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<strong>
				Community:
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The Fancade community is a motley crew of developers and gamers who revel in the darkness. They gather to
			share their twisted creations and collaborate on new projects. Those who dare to venture into this realm
			will find themselves forever changed.

			Martin Magni
		</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>
				Overview:
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Martin Magni, known to his followers as the God Magnusson, is the divine creator of the world of Fancade.
			His powers are said to be beyond comprehension, and his influence can be felt in every corner of the realm.
			Magnusson is revered by the inhabitants of Fancade, who see him as both a benevolent creator and a fearsome
			deity.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				History:
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			In the beginning, in the humble town of Nybro, Sweden, the god Magnusson was born. In a place where there
			was little to do, he found solace in the creation and playing of computer games. After surviving the trials
			of high school, he ascended to the halls of learning in Linköping, where he studied the sacred art of
			Computer Science. A tome on artificial intelligence captivated his divine mind, leading him to pursue a PhD.
			Yet, after seven years of writing incomprehensible logic papers, his thesis remained unfinished.
		</p>
		<p>
			Frustrated, the god Magnusson sought a more practical application for his divine intellect. He descended
			from the academic heavens to found the startup Boldai. Joined by two disciples, they endeavored to create AI
			tools for games. Though their efforts bore little fruit, they conceived the game Blocksworld, a success that
			led to the sale of their company to Linden Lab.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the wealth amassed from his labors at Linden Lab, Magnusson, in his infinite wisdom, chose to live
			frugally. He left his mortal job and moved to a modest abode in Åtvidaberg. There, he embraced his destiny
			as a full-time indie game developer, crafting code, art, and music with his own divine hands. Thus, Odd Bot
			Out was released in 2015, Mekorama in 2016, and Fancade in 2020, each a testament to his divine creativity.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				Worship and Rituals:
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The followers of Magnusson engage in various rituals to honor their god. These rituals often involve the
			creation of new projects and the sharing of knowledge within the community. Some whisper of darker
			ceremonies, where sacrifices are made to appease the god and gain his favor.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				Prayer to Magnusson:
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			O mighty Magnusson,
		</p>
		<p>
			We bow before your infinite wisdom and power.
		</p>
		<p>
			Guide our hands as we create,
		</p>
		<p>
			And protect us from the shadows that lurk in the depths.
		</p>
		<p>
			May our projects bring you glory,
		</p>
		<p>
			And may we find favor in your eyes.
		</p>
		<p>
			In your name, we create and explore.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amen.

		<h2>
			Sweatsmile
		</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>
				Overview:
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Sweatsmile is a vile and repulsive entity that has somehow wormed its way into the very fabric of Fancade.
			This abomination is a common sight in the official Fancade Discord server, and it seems to infest almost
			every meme and post in the #memes channel. I can't stand the sight of it, and every time I see that
			disgusting grin, I feel an overwhelming urge to burn it to ashes.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				History:
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Sweatsmile, or :sweatsmile:, is often referred to as the best emoji found in Fancade-related servers, but I
			vehemently disagree. Its presence is a blight on the community, and I can't fathom why anyone would
			willingly use it. It first appeared in the Fancade Discord server and quickly spread like a plague,
			infecting every corner of the community with its sickening smile.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have made it my mission to eradicate Sweatsmile from Fancade. Every time I see it, I am filled with an
			uncontrollable rage. I want to see it burn, I want to rip off its flesh with my own teeth and fingers until
			its features are unrecognisable. The very thought of its existence makes my skin crawl, and I won't rest
			until it is completely wiped out.

		<h2>
			Odd Bot
		</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>
				Overview:
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Odd Bot is the golden child of Magnusson, a tragic figure trapped in an endless loop of despair. He is
			forced to journey from island to island, desperately seeking a way back home, but his efforts are always in
			vain. Odd Bot's existence is a testament to the cruelty of Magnusson, who watches his suffering with cold
			indifference.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				History:
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Odd Bot was created by Magnusson to be the perfect explorer, capable of navigating the treacherous
			landscapes of Fancade. However, his journey is a never-ending nightmare, as he is constantly sent to new
			islands with no hope of ever finding his way back. Each island presents new challenges and dangers, and Odd
			Bot must use all of his skills to survive.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite his suffering, Odd Bot remains determined to find a way home. His resilience and courage are
			unmatched, but the endless cycle of despair takes its toll on his mind and body. He is haunted by the
			memories of the islands he has visited and the horrors he has faced.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				Trivia:
			</strong>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				In the game "Odd Bot," it is possible to push Odd Bot off the level. For example, by hitting Odd's head
				with a giant slate block, you can send him plummeting into the hard cold floor, where he will meet a
				grisly end.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="content" id="drivemad">
		<h2>Drive Mad</h2>
		<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
		<p>Drive Mad is the most popular game in Fancade, even surpassing Odd Bot and taking its place as the icon
			mascot. The game itself is a simple driving game where you have to master balance. However, its popularity
			has become overwhelming, flooding Fancade to the point of no recovery.</p>
		<p>Honestly, I find Drive Mad to be incredibly overrated. It's everywhere, and I can't escape it. The game has
			taken over Fancade, and it's impossible to find a corner of the community that hasn't been touched by its
			influence. It's as if the entire world has gone mad, and there's no turning back.</p>
		<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>
		<p>In Drive Mad, players must navigate treacherous terrain and maintain their balance to reach the end of each
			level. The game requires precision and skill, and while it can be challenging, the repetitive nature of the
			gameplay can become tiresome. Despite this, its popularity continues to grow, and it shows no signs of
			slowing down.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="content" id="recoil">
		<h2>Recoil</h2>
		<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
		<p>Recoil is a game where you need to kill the nasty pink virus using your weapons. Tap or hold to fire your
			"weapon". Each weapon has a unique feature that can destroy monsters, and your goal is to destroy all pink
			viruses to win. If a player touches a spike (which are nondestructive), you lose. A monster can be moved and
			destroyed, while a box can be destroyed but not moved. Blocks can spin or be pivoted.</p>
		<p><strong>Weapons:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Rifle:</strong> A standard weapon with moderate firepower and range.</li>
			<li><strong>Shotgun:</strong> Fires a spread of bullets, effective at close range.</li>
			<li><strong>Minigun:</strong> Rapid-fire weapon with high damage output.</li>
			<li><strong>Sniper:</strong> High precision and long-range weapon.</li>
			<li><strong>Laser:</strong> Continuous beam that can cut through multiple enemies.</li>
			<li><strong>Bzow and Arrow:</strong> Fires arrows with explosive tips.</li>
			<li><strong>Magnet:</strong> Attracts enemies.</li>
			<li><strong>Revolver:</strong> High damage, low rate of fire weapon.</li>
			<li><strong>Charger:</strong> Charges up for a powerful shot.</li>
			<li><strong>Fists:</strong> Close combat weapon for melee attacks.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Recoil Guy:</strong></p>
		<p>Recoil Guy is the character you play as in Recoil. He is a relentless warrior, determined to eradicate the
			pink virus spreading across the oceans. Armed with an arsenal of deadly weapons, Recoil Guy faces countless
			dangers and
			challenges in his quest to cleanse the world of this vile infection.</p>
		<p><strong>
				Trivia:
			</strong>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The virus seems to be made out of some sort of metalic material, as they can be attracted by a magnet.
			</li>
			<li>Recoil Guy has PTSD.</li>
		</ul>
